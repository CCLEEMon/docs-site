# Web App User Guide

This guide covers the **Life web app** ([life.ccleeai.com](https://life.ccleeai.com)). The web version is the most complete:
the [WeChat mini program](../miniprogram-guide) focuses on quick logging, while chat mode, stats charts, budgets, template backfill,
and account deletion all live here. Both use the same account - data syncs in real time.

The web interface is in Chinese - key on-screen terms are kept in Chinese (in parentheses) so you can find them.

## Quick Start

<StepBox title="1. Sign in (first sign-in registers)">
Open life.ccleeai.com, enter your phone number → tap "Send code" (发送验证码) → enter the SMS code → tap "Sign in" (登录).
Your first sign-in registers the account automatically - no separate sign-up step.
</StepBox>

<StepBox title="2. Log your first entry">
The home input box reads "说点什么：花了20 / 这个月花了多少 / 删掉昨天的咖啡 / 把午餐改成40" - just say it like a message.
The result card shows what was recognized instantly. Nothing is saved before you confirm; undo mistakes or fix the category on the card.
</StepBox>

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Open registration">

Life is currently open to everyone: any phone number with SMS verification can sign in, no invite needed.
New users get example prompts to start with - and every write goes through a confirmation card, so it's safe to just say it.

</InfoBox>

## Logging and Queries (Home)

**What you can say** (examples from the home empty state):

| What you want | What to type (Chinese example) |
|---|---|
| Log an expense | 午餐花了 28 ("lunch cost 28") / 买咖啡 25 ("coffee 25") |
| Log a mood | 今天有点累 ("a bit tired today") / 心情不错，7 分 ("feeling good, 7/10") |
| Log a to-do | 明天交报告 ("report due tomorrow") / 周五记得复诊 ("clinic on Friday") |
| Log medication | 吃了感冒药 ("took cold meds") / 维生素 1 片 ("1 vitamin tablet") |
| Fix / remove | 删掉昨天的咖啡 ("delete yesterday's coffee") / 把午餐改成40 ("change lunch to 40") |
| Query | 这个月花了多少 ("how much this month?") |
| Set a budget | 餐饮预算 2000 ("dining budget 2000") |

**Home dashboard**: total assets, this month's balance (with budget headroom), today's / this month's expenses,
and recent records (with a to-do completion badge, e.g. 待办 3/5).

**Every write goes through a confirmation card:**

- **Logged**: shows "已记 N 笔" (N entries logged) - tap **Undo** (撤销) or **Change category** (改类目)
- **Update / delete**: candidates are listed; tap "Confirm update / Confirm delete" per record (deletion is permanent)
- **Batch updates**: the affected range is previewed first (e.g. "July taxis"), then applied in one go
- **Not found**: tap "补充" (add a hint) and write what you originally meant
- **Wrong recognition**: tap "识别错了" and tell it what it should have been - Life learns and gets more accurate (see [Corrections](#corrections))

<img src="/images/docs/life/web-result-card.png" alt="Result card: 1 entry logged, with Undo and Change category" width="560" loading="lazy" />

## Chat Mode

Enter via the chat icon next to the home input box ("纯聊天模式 · 可发图片记小票" - pure chat, accepts photos).

- **Input modes**: 自动 (auto) / 心情 (mood) / 收支 (expenses) / 待办 (to-dos) / 服药 (medication) / 聊天 (chat).
  "自动" is the default - logging, queries, and fixes all work; switch to "聊天" for pure conversation and queries only
- **Send photos**: receipts and bill screenshots are read automatically and logged; add a text note if you like
- **Companion style**: 倾听者 (listener) or 客观中立 (neutral), switchable anytime
- **New conversation**: clears the current thread to start fresh; history stays viewable (see the "以上为历史" divider)

<InfoBox variant="info" title="A note on safety">

If relevant signals appear in chat, the page shows the psychological assistance hotline **12356** (nationwide, 24 hours).
This reminder is always active and not affected by any setting.

</InfoBox>

## Stats and Budgets

Enter via the "数据统计" shortcut on the home page:

- **收支（近 6 月）**: expense / income trends over the last 6 months
- **支出分类**: spending categories as a donut chart; switch between this month / last month / last 3 months
- **Budget comparison**: per-category budget vs. actual - fill it in under "批量设置 / 编辑预算" on the stats page,
  or just say "餐饮预算 2000" on the home page
- **情绪趋势（近 30 天）**: average score and low / mid / high band distribution
- **To-do completion rate**

## Managing Expenses (Expenses tab)

The second bottom tab "收支" opens the expense records page:

- **Time filter**: this month (calendar panel) / last 3 months / last 6 months / this year / all
- **Inline editing**: tap a record to change category, amount, currency, or note
- **Category management**: create your own categories with optional anchor words ("锚点词，帮 AI 识别") -
  e.g. a "pets" category anchored on "狗粮/猫粮" (dog food / cat food), so "dog food 120" auto-categorizes
- Deletion requires per-record confirmation ("删除该收支记录？")

## Accounts, Transfers, and Lending

Enter via the "账户转账" shortcut on the home page:

- **Add account**: name + currency (**can't be changed later**); optional anchor words (e.g. "招行/储蓄卡") help recognition
- **Transfers**: moving money between your own accounts - **not counted as income or spending**; cross-currency transfers need the received amount
- **Balance adjustments**: interest / fees / opening balance / reconciliation fixes; negative amounts allowed, not counted in income/spending; pick a reason from the fixed list
- Transfer / adjustment entries can be deleted (account balance rolls back accordingly)
- **Lending**: say "借出100" ("lent out 100") or "还了 50" ("paid back 50") to log loans and repayments; ask "某某还欠多少" ("how much does X still owe") anytime

## Mood and Stress Self-Checks

Enter via the "心理健康" shortcut on the home page:

1. Pick one self-check: **情绪自评** (Mood Self-Check) / **压力自评** (Stress Self-Check) / **情绪速测** (Quick Mood Check) - the page shows "N questions · max M points"
2. One question per screen - answer honestly about "the past two weeks" (完全不会 / 好几天 / 一半以上 / 几乎每天: not at all / several days / more than half the days / nearly every day)
3. Results appear instantly (e.g. "steady", "elevated stress - consider seeking support"); tap "再测一次" to retake
4. "历史记录" keeps every past result; "筛查趋势（近 14 天）" (14-day trend) shows changes over time

**Where do the questions come from - are they professional?**

The three self-checks are adapted from internationally standardized questionnaires:
**情绪自评** corresponds to PHQ-9, **压力自评** to GAD-7, and **情绪速测** (PHQ-4) is a short combination of both.
They are widely used for initial self-assessment of mood and stress; scoring and result bands are computed server-side.

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Please read">

Results are for self-assessment only and are not a medical diagnosis; if something feels heavy, please seek professional help.
If you are in distress or having thoughts of harming yourself: you don't have to face it alone - call the psychological assistance hotline **12356** (nationwide, 24 hours); in an emergency, go to the nearest hospital emergency department or mental health center.

## Templates and Batch Backfill

Enter via the "模板补录" shortcut - built for **missed recurring entries** (rent, daily medication, salary):

1. **Create a template**: pick a type (expenses / mood / to-dos / medication) and fill in the fixed content (e.g. "rent 3000", "二甲双胍 1 片")
2. **Batch backfill**: pick a template → set "entries per day / number of days / end date" → preview the range (e.g. 7月1日 ～ 7月31日 · 1 entry per day · 31 total) → confirm
3. Only **past** dates are backfilled, never future ones; entries are **not de-duplicated** - submitting twice creates duplicates (the confirm dialog says so)

## Corrections

Enter from Settings or the home shortcuts. Every correction you make on a result card (changing a category, "识别错了")
becomes a teaching example automatically, and Life applies your phrasing going forward. This page lists accumulated
examples (e.g. "pet snacks → pets") and lets you delete any you no longer want taught.

## Settings and Account

Open via the gear icon in the top-right corner:

- **Theme**: follow system / light / dark
- **Proactive care**: how often chat proactively checks in on you (常规 / 适度 / 关闭 - regular / moderate / off); safety-signal reminders are always on
- **Balance hints**: after logging an expense, append this month's balance and budget headroom to the confirmation (show / hide)
- **Default currency**: used when a log entry doesn't mention one (no exchange-rate conversion)
- **Nickname**, **sign out**

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Deleting your account">

Settings → bottom "危险操作" → "注销账号": after SMS verification, **all data is permanently deleted**
(expenses, mood, medication, lending, accounts, etc.) and cannot be recovered.
To remove just a few records, use per-record deletion instead - don't delete the whole account.

</InfoBox>

## FAQ

**How do the web app and mini program relate?**
Same account, same data, synced in real time. The mini program is for quick logging; the web app has everything
(chat mode, stats, budgets, template backfill, account deletion). A good combo: log on the mini program, review stats on the web.

**What about switching phones or devices?**
Data lives on the server. Open life.ccleeai.com in any browser, sign in with your phone number and an SMS code - all history is there.

**What if the AI misreads me?**
Four layers of fixes, getting more accurate over time: "Undo / Change category" rescues the record;
"识别错了" teaches it for next time; "补充" helps it locate what it missed; and the Corrections page manages long-term habits.

**Is my data safe? Can I delete everything?**
Sensitive content is stored encrypted and system logs never record your raw text (see [Privacy & Data Security](../privacy-security)).
Delete individual records one by one; to wipe everything use "注销账号" - permanent and unrecoverable.

**Are the self-checks a medical diagnosis?**
No. Results are for self-understanding only, not a medical diagnosis; please seek professional help if something feels heavy (hotline 12356 is shown in the app).

**Which currencies are supported? Is there automatic conversion?**
CNY / USD / EUR / JPY / HKD / TWD are supported. Entries are recorded in the currency you mention, stats are grouped per currency, and **no exchange-rate conversion is applied**.
